# Workout Log
This is my first server-side application that I've built during my course at Eleven Fifty Academy.

We were challenged to build only the server side of a Workout Log application without the guidance of instructors following a lecture and module covering the topic.

## Endpoint Screen Shots
Below are screen shots showing the functionality of my end points that I tested while building the app.
